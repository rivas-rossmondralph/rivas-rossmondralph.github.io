      <h2>Company Overview</h2>
      <img src="assets/companyLogo.png" alt="Company Logo" class="company-logo" />
      <p>iNeed Solution Inc. is a Makati-based software development firm known for its work on parking reservation systems. While the company operates from a central office, they support remote engagements, which allowed me to complete my practicum from home. Their experience in designing reservation systems guided the direction of our practicum project, where we were tasked to collaboratively build a functional parking reservation application. The development process mirrored a professional software environment, offering us valuable exposure to industry practices.</p>

      <h2>Nature of Assignments or Tasks Given</h2>
      <p>The practicum was divided into two phases. The first involved familiarization with the development tools used in the company’s workflow. We practiced backend development using C# and ASP.NET, mobile development using Flutter and Dart, and worked with MongoDB for database operations. We also learned to host applications using IIS, schedule tasks with Windows Task Scheduler, and manage version control through Git and GitHub. In the second phase, we were grouped and assigned specific components of the reservation system. I was tasked with leading the logging module, which records important actions across various parts of the app. This included designing the log structure, implementing secure event tracking, and coordinating with other teams to ensure proper integration.</p>

      <h2>Total Hours Rendered</h2>
      <p>I completed a total of 437 hours during my practicum. Approximately 180 hours were spent on training tasks to build familiarity with the tools and frameworks, including a focused period to study Flutter. The remaining hours were dedicated to the development of the logging module. I successfully integrated the logger with the account management module, enabling it to track and store actions triggered by users and other modules. By the time I concluded my practicum on July 15, 2025, I had laid a stable foundation for the logging system that future developers could expand upon.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>This practicum offered valuable insights into both the technical and collaborative aspects of software development. Working on the logging module challenged me to think critically about data handling, particularly around security and interoperability between systems. I learned to identify and avoid potential vulnerabilities—such as exposing user emails in logs—and honed my debugging skills using tools like Visual Studio. Equally important was the experience of working within a batch of fifteen students split into smaller groups of around two members each, with my own group focused specifically on logging. This structure required clear communication and coordination to ensure that all modules worked together smoothly, teaching me to take initiative, adapt quickly, and take pride in building something that supports the system as a whole.</p>
